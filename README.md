This repository showcases my journey through Google’s Cybersecurity Professional Certificates program. It includes key concepts, hands-on projects, and skills gained, covering topics like threat detection, network security, incident response, and cloud security, demonstrating my proficiency in modern cybersecurity practices.

1. [Botium Toys Risk Assessment](https://github.com/KAmii-cxo/Risk-Assesment-Report-Botium-Toys)
   
   The project involves conducting a security audit on a chatbot framework called Botium. The goal is to assess the security of the framework, identify vulnerabilities, and suggest improvements to enhance the safety of the chatbot system.

2. [Control Categories](https://github.com/KAmii-cxo/Control-Categories-)

   It is the classification of different types of security measures or practices designed to protect systems, networks, and data from threats.
   
3. [Controls and Compliance Checklist](https://github.com/KAmii-cxo/Controls-And-Compliance-Checklist)

   This checklist evaluates Botium Toys' security controls and compliance with standards like PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC.
   
4. [Cybersecurity Incident Report : Network Traffic Analysis](https://github.com/KAmii-cxo/Cybersecurity-Incident-Report-Network-Traffic-Analysis) 

   This activity investigates an issue with unreachable port 443 when accessing a secure employee background check website. The network security team uses tcpdump to analyze traffic, suspecting either a firewall misconfiguration or a potential malicious attack. The team is working to restore access and identify the cause.

5. [Apply OS Hardening Techniques Report](https://github.com/KAmii-cxo/Apply-OS-Hardening-Technique-Incident-Report)

   This report covers a cybersecurity incident where HTTP traffic was used to deliver malware via a compromised website. A brute force attack allowed the attacker to lock out the legitimate admin and inject malicious code. The report includes an analysis of the incident and recommendations for remediations, such as improved password policies and two-factor authentication (2FA).

6. [Security Risk Assessment Report](https://github.com/KAmii-cxo/Security-Assessment-Report)

   The reports consists of hardening tools and methodology to implement, and details elaboration about them.

   5 core functions that help organizations manage digital security risk.

8. [Incident Report Analysis](https://github.com/KAmii-cxo/Incident-Report-Analysis)

   This document provides a detailed analysis of a recent cybersecurity incident involving unauthorized access to a customer database through phishing. It outlines the actions taken during each phase of incident response—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—while proposing measures to strengthen security and prevent future attacks.

9. [LINUX Guide](https://github.com/KAmii-cxo/LINUX-Guide)

   Reference for commmands in Linux

10. [SQL](https://github.com/KAmii-cxo/SQL)
